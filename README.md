### **Salvatore Formisano**  
**Engineering Manager · Full-Stack Developer · Systems Architect**

I’m a software engineer with more than fifteen years of experience building distributed systems, developer tools, and full-stack applications.

I still write code every day because I believe leaders should stay close to the craft.

As a manager, I focus on trust, autonomy, and clear communication.  
I value teams that take ownership and care deeply about what they deliver.

Over the past four years I’ve developed a strong focus on Rust.  
I believe it represents the future of reliable, high-performance software, and I use it to explore ideas around scalability, resilience, and simplicity in system design.

I’m currently creating frameworks and lessons that share what I’ve learned about building strong engineering cultures and sustainable technical systems.  

My goal is simple: build products, tools, and teams that create lasting value for both users and the people who make them.
